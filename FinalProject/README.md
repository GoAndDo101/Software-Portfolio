{I wanted to experiment with an idea I had been experimenting with for a while. A program that allowed you to build
a small world from the ground up. Reminiscent of the stories told by J.R.R Tolkein and other great authors}

{This program allows you to create your own world. It asks you the name of the world and allows you to 
creatre characters, locations, and kingdoms. The skill that I learned from this was how to manage multiple 
overlapping classes that effect other classes}
